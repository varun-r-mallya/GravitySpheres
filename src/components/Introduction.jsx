        <p> Students often struggle with understanding complex graph algorithms due to their abstract nature and the difficulty 
            of visualizing the underlying processes. Concepts like traversal, shortest paths, and graph connectivity involve intricate 
            operations that can be challenging to grasp without a concrete representation. Textbook explanations and pseudocode can be 
            overwhelming, leaving students confused about how algorithms work step-by-step and how they manipulate graph structures. 
            This confusion can hinder their ability to debug their own implementations and fully comprehend the theoretical foundations 
            of these algorithms.

        <p> A graph algorithms visualizer addresses these challenges by providing a dynamic, visual representation of algorithms in action. 
            By graphically displaying the traversal of nodes, edge weights, and intermediate states, these tools make the abstract 
            operations of algorithms more tangible and easier to follow. Students can interact with the visualizer to observe how algorithms 
            evolve in real time, which clarifies the impact of each operation and aids in debugging. This visual approach not only enhances 
            comprehension but also makes learning more engaging and intuitive, helping students grasp complex concepts and apply them effectively.
